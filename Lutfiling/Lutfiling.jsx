                    <div className="gst_filing"><h3>Who needs to file LUT in Form GST RFD-11?</h3></div>

                    CGST Act or the Integrated Goods and Service Act, 2017 or any existing laws are not eligible
                    to file the GST LUT. In such cases, they would have to furnish an Export bond.  <br /> <br />

                    Here the motive of the government was to expand the export base by providing reliefs on
                    exports. GST experts from IndiaFilings can help you with GST LUT filing or Export bond Filing.  <br /> <br />

                    Under CGST Rules,2017, any registered person can furnish an Export bond or LUT in GST RFD 11

                        mentioned will have to furnish an export bond and a bank guarantee. The applicant needs
                        to cover the amount of tax involved in the export based on estimated tax liability
                        self-assessment.  <br /><br />

                        Export bond should be furnished on non-judicial stamp paper of the value as applicable in
                        the State in which the bond is being furnished. <br /><br />

                        Also, exporters can furnish a running bond, so that export bond needs not to be executed for
                        each export transaction. However, if the outstanding tax liability on exports exceeds the bond
                        amount at any time, then the exporter must furnish a new bond to cover the additional liability.  <br /><br />

                        A bank guarantee can be mandated along with an export bond. The value of the bank
                        guarantee should usually not exceed 15% of the bond amount. However, based on the exporter's
                        track record, the bank guarantee required to be submitted with the export bond can be
                        waived off by the jurisdictional GST Commissioner.
